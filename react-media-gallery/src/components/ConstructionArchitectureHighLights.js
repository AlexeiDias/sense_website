          <h2 className='titleColor'>Enhanced Client Engagement</h2>
          <p>Virtual tours enable clients to visualize architectural designs and construction progress in a highly immersive and interactive manner. This technology helps bridge the gap between technical drawings and the completed project, allowing clients to better understand the vision and details of their investment.</p>

          <h2 className='titleColor'>Improved Project Collaboration</h2>
          <p>Virtual tours facilitate collaboration among architects, engineers, contractors, and clients, regardless of their physical location. Stakeholders can virtually walk through the construction site or architectural model, discuss changes, and make decisions in real-time, leading to more efficient project management and reduced misunderstandings.</p>

          <p> For architects and builders, virtual tours serve as a powerful marketing tool, showcasing their capabilities and previous projects in a dynamic, engaging format. This can help attract new clients by demonstrating expertise and the ability to deliver high-quality projects.</p>

          <h2 className='titleColor'>Reduced Need for Physical Site Visits</h2>
          <p>Virtual tours can significantly reduce the frequency of physical site visits, saving time and resources for both clients and project teams. This is particularly beneficial for projects in remote locations or for clients who are based far from the construction site.</p>

          <h2 className='titleColor'>Early Detection of Design Issues</h2>
          <p id='people'>By providing a realistic view of the project before construction begins, virtual tours can help identify design issues or potential improvements early in the process. This proactive approach can prevent costly modifications during construction and ensure the final build more closely aligns with client expectations.</p>
